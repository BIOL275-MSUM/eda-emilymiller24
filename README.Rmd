# Correlation Between Poverty and Unemployment Rates by County in Minnesota

Emily Miller & Chris Merkord

Biosciences Department, Minnesota State University Moorhead, 1104 7th Avenue South, Moorhead, MN 56563 USA

## Abstract

Poverty is an issue all around the world and I wanted to see what the specifics
were like in my home state. I wanted to see if some of the causes for it had a
major effect on it as well. I aimed to see if there was any connection to the 
poverty and unemployment rates in Minnesota. I examined how poverty is affected 
and thought that unemployment could be a good example to use.

For my experiment, I will be using R Studio to look at the different datasets I 
have and create graphs out of it. I got the population poverty rates from the 
KIDS COUNT data center. I got the unemployment rates from the Minnesota 
Employment and Economic Development site.

My hypothesis is that the poverty and unemployment rates have a relationship and 
progress along with each other. I expect the rates for both poverty and 
unemployment to correlate with each other during the years. Meaning that if one 
goes down, I expect the other to follow. And vice versa if one increases.

Poverty and unemployment are both issues that everyday people have to deal with. 
I just aspired to see if these two issues somehow had a connection with each 
other.

## Introduction

Poverty is a problem all around the globe. One that we should be focusing on 
more to ensure happy and healthy people everywhere. Poverty, to explain a little 
bit, is someone living in a society in where they do not have the basic needs 
for life. Such as food, water or clothing.

There are about 40.6 million people just in the United states that are living in 
poverty. There are many factors that could affect poverty, a few being; access 
to food and water, having disabilities, lack of health care and many other 
factors. But one that I wanted to compare to poverty, was unemployment.

Unemployment is another problem that we as people have to deal with. There are 
about 10 million unemployed people in the United States alone. Unemployed people 
not only are losing income, but they face many other challenges. Some so that 
lead to physical or mental problems.

Unemployment is a factor that wages in on poverty, and I wanted to further look 
at the stats and see if there was a real correlation between the two things. So 
I dug into some data for both in relation to the state of Minnesota. I wanted to 
see what this looked like on a smaller level, and how it affected one state 
aside from them all. I also just wanted to see how it affected the state that I 
live in.

## Methods

### Data Acquisition

I'm going to start off by explaining where I found and obtained all of my data 
from.

First off, I clicked on the KIDS COUNT (Annie E. Casey Foundation 2021) website 
link from Dr. Merkord's github list. The URL is included below:

https://datacenter.kidscount.org/

Then I clicked on the state of Minnesota to look for things specific to the 
state. I found my data set under the Poverty tab, with the name as Entire 
Population Living in Poverty.

After clicking on the data set, I clicked by county to show all of the counties 
since my data set is for Minnesota counties. I wanted all of the county data and
not just the state.

I then clicked on raw data, which created an excel spreadsheet for me. I then 
went into my folders and put the spreadsheet into my data folder under my R 
studio project to save it onto R Studio. I was then able to open it and process 
it from there.

Before we get into how I processed the data, I had another data set that I used.
But I got it from a different website. I looked this up myself, searching 
unemployment rate mn dataset into google.

I then clicked on the second link that said State and National Employment and 
Unemployment (DEED) 2021. The URL is listed below:

https://mn.gov/deed/data/current-econ-highlights/state-national-employment.jsp

This link brought me to the Employment and Economic Development section of the 
Minnesota Government website.

I scrolled to the bottom and clicked on, 'Select this link for more data' and it 
brought me to a place to select data.

I examined the list and clicked on Minnesota Counties, and then hit submit. I 
was then brought to a list of Minnesota counties. I wasn't able to select all of
them at the same time, so I held the Ctrl button and I clicked on the first 
forty counties.

I then clicked on current statistics and it brought me to a list of the counties 
with a lot of different columns. Such as a graph, the area, employment, 
unemployment and the unemployment rate. In order to find the data of all the 
counties selected, I had to click See Historical Data for these areas at the 
bottom of the list.

Once I clicked on this, I was brought to the data set table that had the list of 
all the counties I had clicked on with their unemployment rate listed by month. 
I then set the years of which I needed, being from 2000-2012, and changed the 
frequency from monthly to annually. I then clicked download data, where I then 
downloaded the excel file.

I did the same thing with the poverty data to bring it into R Studio through the 
data folder. I did the whole process with getting the county data the same way 
for the next forty seven counties I had left over.

### Data Preparation

To start analyzing the data, I used R version 4.0.3 (R Core Team 2020), RStudio 
Version 1.3.1093 (RStudio Team 2020), and then the packages Tidyverse 
(Wickham et al., 2019), and readxl (Hadley Wickham and Jennifer Bryan 2019).

Before I could start analyzing the data, I had to put the data into RStudio. To 
do that, I opened the file folder on my laptop and found the excel files under 
downloads. I dragged the files into the folder for my project, titled EDA. To 
which I then put into the data folder so that all of my data was in one place.

Now I have three data files to use, one for poverty, and two for the 
unemployment rate since I split them in half. To start it off, I took my
poverty data table and read it using the read_excel function. I then filtered 
out the LocationType column so that it only had results with County in them. I 
did the same thing with the column DataFormat so that it only had Percent.

I then loaded in the two unemployment rate data sets, naming them Unemprate 1 
and Unemprate 2. I took the two data sets and joined them so they were on one 
data set, to which I named unemployment.

I changed the name of the column Year/Month so that it was just year and turned 
that column into an integer. To get the columns I need for the rest of my 
project, I used the select function and chose the year, county and unemployment
columns.

I then went back to the poverty data set and selected the TimeFrame, Location 
and Data columns. To which I then renamed so they would match the unemployment 
table. I changed TimeFrame to year, Location to county, and Data to poverty.

I then took the unemployment data set and used the mutate function to get rid of 
the space and the word county from the county column. So that it didn't say 
county after every single one. So that it would combine with the poverty data 
set later on.

I also had to change the county Saint Louis, to St. Louis in the unemployment 
data set so that it matched the poverty one.

After that was done, I went back to the poverty data set and used the mutate 
function to change the year as an integer and make sure poverty was a numeric
property.

Now, all of the columns are labeled the same thing in both the poverty and
unemployment data sets. I combined the data sets and labeled the new data set 
pe. Now all of my data is on one set and I'm ready to start analyzing it.

# Making Maps -------------------------------------------------------------


map1 <- map_data("county") %>% 
  as_tibble()


map2 <-filter(map1, region=="minnesota")


merge1 <- rename(pe, subregion=county)


merge2 <- mutate(merge1, subregion=str_to_lower(subregion))


mergedcounties <- inner_join(map2, merge2, by= "subregion")

mergedcounties %>%  
  filter(year == 2000) %>% 
  ggplot() + 
  geom_polygon(
    mapping = aes(x=long, y=lat, group=group, fill = unemployment), 
    color = "white", size = 0.2
  ) +
  coord_map("albers", lat0 = 43.5, lat1 = 49) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(
    limits = c(2,15),
    direction = -1
  ) +

    axis.ticks = element_blank(),
    panel.background = element_blank()
  )
```

The map above shows the unemployment rate of every county in the state of 
Minnesota for the year 2000. So the colors of the counties correlate with the 
legend to the side to show what the rate was for that county in that year. This 
map is called Map 1.

```{r}
mergedcounties %>% 
  filter(year == 2012) %>% 
  ggplot() + 
  geom_polygon(
    mapping = aes(x=long, y=lat, group=group, fill = unemployment), 
    color = "white", size = 0.2
  ) +
  coord_map("albers", lat0 = 43.5, lat1 = 49) +

```{r}
# Correlation -------------------------------------------------------------

ggplot(mergedcounties,
       aes(x = poverty, y = unemployment, color = year)) +
  geom_point()
```

The graph above shows the correlation between unemployment and poverty rates in 
the state of Minnesota. Each dot represents a year per county in Minnesota. So 
since there are 13 years and 87 counties in my data set, there should be 1131 
dots. The different colored dots show the changes in years. This graph is called 
Map 5.

## Discussion

To start off my explanation of my results, I'll make a note that map 1 and map 2
are of the poverty levels. Then map 2 and map 3 are comparing unemployment 
rates. And finally map 5 is a correlation map between poverty and unemployment. 
I'll go into more details on all of them as I discuss them.

Map 1 is a map of Minnesota's counties with the unemployment rate during the 
year 2000. So that means the colors shown on the map represent the counties 
unemployment data for that year. The lighter colors in the yellow and light 
greens show a lower unemployment rate for that specific county. So the counties 
on that map in the lower part of Minnesota have low unemployment rates, but 
those in Northern Minnesota have higher ones.

Now map 2 is also showing the unemployment rates in the counties in Minnesota, 
but this map was during the year 2012. This map shows that the colors change 
significantly between the two maps. This one is darker in color all around for 
the most part. The yellow coloring in the lower half of the state are now green 
in color and in the north the colors are a darker blue/green.

This helps with my hypothesis, because over the thirteen years that I have 
represented in the maps, for the most part the unemployment rate increased.

Maps 3 and 4 represent the poverty rates in Minnesota instead of the 
unemployment rates. Map 3 is the year 2000 and it represents the poverty rates 
per county of that year. This one has lighter colors like yellow and greens just 
like the unemployment map for the same year.

Map 4 shows the poverty rates for the year 2012, so like the other maps, 
thirteen years are between the two maps. The fourth map is also a lot darker 
than it's counterpart. With some dark blues in a few in the north and some 
darker greens in the south. But overall the counties are all just a little bit 
darker.

This also helps with my hypothesis by showing that the poverty rate for the most 
part has increased.

The last map, map 5, shows how poverty and unemployment have correlated 
throughout the years in all the counties. The darker colors indicate further 
back years such as 2000 and 2001, but as the colors get lighter, it means the 
years are getting later. Overall, the dots are bunched up, but you can tell that 
there seems to be a sort of increase as both numbers rise the other one does 
too.

This also sort of helps my hypothesis. I would say I would not reject my 
hypothesis. Although I can't tell directly if one affects the other, the data 
that I had shows what my hypothesis was; that both correlate with each other. 
The maps that I had showed this since they both increased throughout the years.
