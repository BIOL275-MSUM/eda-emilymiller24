First off, I clicked on the KIDS COUNT website link from Dr. Merkord's github list. The URL is included below:

https://datacenter.kidscount.org/

Then I clicked on the state of Minnesota to look for things specific to the state. I found my data set under the Poverty tab, with the name as Entire Population Living in Poverty.

After clicking on the data set, I clicked by county to show all of the counties since my data set is for Minnesota counties. I wanted all of the county data and not just the state.
