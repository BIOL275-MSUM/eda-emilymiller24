### Data Acquisition

I'm going to start off by explaining where I found and obtained all of my data 
from.

First off, I clicked on the KIDS COUNT (Annie E. Casey Foundation 2021) website 
link from Dr. Merkord's github list. The URL is included below:

https://datacenter.kidscount.org/

Then I clicked on the state of Minnesota to look for things specific to the 
state. I found my data set under the Poverty tab, with the name as Entire 
Population Living in Poverty.

After clicking on the data set, I clicked by county to show all of the counties 
since my data set is for Minnesota counties. I wanted all of the county data and
not just the state.

I then clicked on raw data, which created an excel spreadsheet for me. I then 
went into my folders and put the spreadsheet into my data folder under my R 
studio project to save it onto R Studio. I was then able to open it and process 
it from there.

Before we get into how I processed the data, I had another data set that I used.
But I got it from a different website. I looked this up myself, searching 
unemployment rate mn dataset into google.

I then clicked on the second link that said State and National Employment and 
Unemployment (DEED) 2021. The URL is listed below:

https://mn.gov/deed/data/current-econ-highlights/state-national-employment.jsp

This link brought me to the Employment and Economic Development section of the 
Minnesota Government website.

I scrolled to the bottom and clicked on, 'Select this link for more data' and it 
brought me to a place to select data.

I examined the list and clicked on Minnesota Counties, and then hit submit. I 
was then brought to a list of Minnesota counties. I wasn't able to select all of
them at the same time, so I held the Ctrl button and I clicked on the first 
forty counties.

I then clicked on current statistics and it brought me to a list of the counties 
with a lot of different columns. Such as a graph, the area, employment, 
unemployment and the unemployment rate. In order to find the data of all the 
counties selected, I had to click See Historical Data for these areas at the 
bottom of the list.

Once I clicked on this, I was brought to the data set table that had the list of 
all the counties I had clicked on with their unemployment rate listed by month. 
I then set the years of which I needed, being from 2000-2012, and changed the 
frequency from monthly to annually. I then clicked download data, where I then 
downloaded the excel file.

I did the same thing with the poverty data to bring it into R Studio through the 
data folder. I did the whole process with getting the county data the same way 
for the next forty seven counties I had left over.

### Data Preparation

To start analyzing the data, I used R version 4.0.3 (R Core Team 2020), RStudio 
Version 1.3.1093 (RStudio Team 2020), and then the packages Tidyverse 
(Wickham et al., 2019), and readxl (Hadley Wickham and Jennifer Bryan 2019).

Before I could start analyzing the data, I had to put the data into RStudio. To 
do that, I opened the file folder on my laptop and found the excel files under 
downloads. I dragged the files into the folder for my project, titled EDA. To 
which I then put into the data folder so that all of my data was in one place.

Now I have three data files to use, one for poverty, and two for the 
unemployment rate since I split them in half. To start it off, I took my poverty 
data table and read it using the read_excel function. I then filtered out the LocationType column so that it only had results with County in them. I did the 
same thing with the column DataFormat so that it only had Percent.

I then loaded in the two unemployment rate data sets, naming them Unemprate 1 
and Unemprate 2. I took the two data sets and joined them so they were on one 
data set, to which I named unemployment.

I changed the name of the column Year/Month so that it was just year and turned 
that column into an integer. To get the columns I need for the rest of my 
project, I used the select function and chose the year, county and unemployment
columns.

I then went back to the poverty data set and selected the TimeFrame, Location 
and Data columns. To which I then renamed so they would match the unemployment 
table. I changed TimeFrame to year, Location to county, and Data to poverty.

I then took the unemployment data set and used the mutate function to get rid of 
the space and the word county from the county column. So that it didn't say 
county after every single one. So that it would combine with the poverty data 
set later on.

I also had to change the county Saint Louis, to St. Louis in the unemployment 
data set so that it matched the poverty one.

After that was done, I went back to the poverty data set and used the mutate 
function to change the year as an integer and make sure poverty was a numeric
property.

Now, all of the columns are labeled the same thing in both the poverty and
unemployment data sets. I combined the data sets and labeled the new data set 
pe. Now all of my data is on one set and I'm ready to start analyzing it.
